# Icon Conversion Instructions

## New Monitor Icon

The user has provided a new monitor icon image that needs to be converted to ICO format and saved as `monitor-icon.ico`.

### Steps to complete the icon update:

1. **Convert the provided image to ICO format:**
   - The image shows a monitor with circular refresh arrows
   - Convert to ICO format with multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
   - Save as `Resources/monitor-icon.ico`

2. **Replace the placeholder file:**
   - The current `monitor-icon.ico` is just a placeholder text file
   - Replace it with the actual ICO file converted from the user's image

3. **Verify the implementation:**
   - The project file is already configured to use the icon as ApplicationIcon
   - The TrayManager and MainForm are updated to load from resources
   - Both have fallback to programmatically created icons if loading fails

### Tools for conversion:
- Online converters: convertio.co, icoconvert.com
- Desktop tools: GIMP, Paint.NET with ICO plugin
- Command line: ImageMagick

### Image Description:
The provided image shows a modern monitor icon with:
- Gray/slate colored monitor frame
- Dark screen area
- White circular refresh arrows (clockwise direction)
- Clean, professional appearance suitable for a monitor management application
